A simple (gradient-heavy) single pager that revisits a style I messed with on two
previous designs (Tessellate and Telephasic). Fully responsive, built on Sass,
and, as usual, loaded with an assortment of pre-styled elements. Have fun! :)

This is a site for my 3D prints that I have printed not all of the designs that are seen on th epage are made by me.
If this is the case then a note will be placed on the page as well as the link to the oringial design.
However most of the other work is my designs and these will also have links to the work and where one might be able
to download and print yourself this also goes for code. You can copy the code from the bottom of the page for the 
project you want to make yourself.
